I'm tired of punching keyboard navigation keys to move my cursor one by one line in IntelliJ IDE. Is there any plugin which can jump multiple number of lines? If any, provide me link too.
ChatGPT
In IntelliJ IDEA, you can use the "Goto Line" feature to quickly jump to a specific line number. You don't need an additional plugin for this. Here's how you can use it:

Windows/Linux: Press Ctrl + G
Mac: Press Cmd + L

A dialog will appear where you can enter the line number you want to jump to.

Alternatively, if you're looking to navigate up or down by a specific number of lines, you can use the following shortcuts:

Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Arrow Up/Down
Mac: Cmd + Arrow Up/Down
If these built-in features don't meet your needs, IntelliJ IDEA provides extensive keyboard shortcuts and customizability. You can check the available keymap options or customize them according to your preferences:

Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Alt + S (Settings) > Keymap
Mac: Cmd + , (Preferences) > Keymap
No specific plugin is needed for these functionalities. If you prefer plugins, the IntelliJ IDEA marketplace (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/) is a good place to search for and install plugins based on your specific needs. However, for basic line navigation, the built-in features and shortcuts mentioned above should be sufficient.

I don't want to jump on specific line number. I want to jump over N lines to reduce the use of navigation keys.
ChatGPT
I understand now. To jump over N lines in IntelliJ IDEA without using the arrow keys, you can use the "Navigate Line" feature with the "Move Caret" option. Here's how you can do it:

Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Alt + Arrow Up/Down
Mac: Cmd + Alt + Arrow Up/Down

A small popup will appear, allowing you to input the number of lines you want to jump. Enter a positive number to move down or a negative number to move up.

This way, you can quickly navigate multiple lines in IntelliJ IDEA without pressing the arrow keys repeatedly. This feature is quite flexible and should help streamline your workflow.

This won't be more satisfied as expected.
ChatGPT
If you're looking for more advanced cursor movement options and find the built-in IntelliJ IDEA features insufficient, you might want to explore plugins that enhance cursor movement or introduce additional navigation shortcuts. Keep in mind that plugin availability and compatibility may vary based on your IntelliJ IDEA version. Here are a couple of plugins that might help:

IdeaVim:

If you are familiar with Vim keybindings, you might find the IdeaVim plugin useful. It brings Vim keybindings to IntelliJ IDEA, which includes efficient cursor movement commands.
You can find it in the IntelliJ IDEA marketplace or directly install it from your IDE: File > Settings > Plugins > search for "IdeaVim."
CamelCase and SnakeCase Navigation:

This plugin enhances cursor movement by allowing you to jump between camelCase and snake_case words using keyboard shortcuts.
Install it from the IntelliJ IDEA marketplace.
Remember to check the plugin documentation for usage instructions and compatibility with your IntelliJ IDEA version. Additionally, be aware that installing many plugins may impact IDE performance, so choose plugins based on your specific needs.

To install a plugin:

Open IntelliJ IDEA.
Go to File > Settings (or Preferences on macOS).
Select Plugins.
Click on Marketplace or Browse repositories.
Search for the desired plugin and install it.
After installing a plugin, restart IntelliJ IDEA to apply the changes.

I have following code snippets for setting panel of Jetbrain plugin which shows its content vertically or we can say in column. I have couple of TextField and its header. I want to show it like in horizontal way
class JumpLinesSettingPanel {

    val panel: JPanel
    private val numberOfLinesForwardTextField = JTextField()
    private val numberOfLinesBackwardTextField = JTextField()

    init {
        val layout = VerticalLayout(/* gap = */ 2,/* alignment = */ SwingConstants.LEFT)
        panel = JPanel(layout)

        val forwardLabel = JLabel(/* text = */ "Number of lines to jump forward:")
        panel.add(forwardLabel)
        panel.add(numberOfLinesForwardTextField)

        val backwardLabel = JLabel(/* text = */ "Number of lines to jump backward:")
        panel.add(backwardLabel)
        panel.add(numberOfLinesBackwardTextField)
    }
}
ChatGPT
If you want to arrange your components horizontally in a single row, you can use a layout manager that supports horizontal layout. One commonly used layout manager for this purpose is FlowLayout. Here's how you can modify your code to use FlowLayout for a horizontal layout:

kotlin
Copy code
import javax.swing.*
import java.awt.*

class JumpLinesSettingPanel {

    val panel: JPanel
    private val numberOfLinesForwardTextField = JTextField()
    private val numberOfLinesBackwardTextField = JTextField()

    init {
        // Use FlowLayout with LEFT alignment
        val layout = FlowLayout(FlowLayout.LEFT)
        panel = JPanel(layout)

        val forwardLabel = JLabel("Number of lines to jump forward:")
        panel.add(forwardLabel)
        panel.add(numberOfLinesForwardTextField)

        val backwardLabel = JLabel("Number of lines to jump backward:")
        panel.add(backwardLabel)
        panel.add(numberOfLinesBackwardTextField)
    }
}
In this modification, I replaced VerticalLayout with FlowLayout and specified FlowLayout.LEFT as the alignment. This will arrange the components in a single row from left to right.

You can customize the FlowLayout further according to your preferences by adjusting the constructor parameters or exploring other layout managers based on your specific needs.

I want one label and one text field in a single row. Next in next row.
ChatGPT
Certainly, to achieve a layout where each label and text field pair is on a new row, you can use a layout manager that supports vertical stacking. You can use GridBagLayout with constraints to achieve this. Here's the modified code:

kotlin
Copy code
import javax.swing.*
import java.awt.*

class JumpLinesSettingPanel {

    val panel: JPanel
    private val numberOfLinesForwardTextField = JTextField()
    private val numberOfLinesBackwardTextField = JTextField()

    init {
        // Use GridBagLayout for vertical stacking
        val layout = GridBagLayout()
        panel = JPanel(layout)

        // GridBagConstraints for left-aligned components
        val constraints = GridBagConstraints()
        constraints.anchor = GridBagConstraints.WEST
        constraints.insets = Insets(2, 2, 2, 2)  // Optional: add padding

        // Add forward label and text field in the first row
        val forwardLabel = JLabel("Number of lines to jump forward:")
        constraints.gridx = 0
        constraints.gridy = 0
        panel.add(forwardLabel, constraints)

        constraints.gridx = 1
        constraints.gridy = 0
        panel.add(numberOfLinesForwardTextField, constraints)

        // Add backward label and text field in the second row
        val backwardLabel = JLabel("Number of lines to jump backward:")
        constraints.gridx = 0
        constraints.gridy = 1
        panel.add(backwardLabel, constraints)

        constraints.gridx = 1
        constraints.gridy = 1
        panel.add(numberOfLinesBackwardTextField, constraints)
    }
}
In this modification:

I switched to GridBagLayout, which is a versatile layout manager.
I used GridBagConstraints to set constraints for each component, specifying the row (gridy) and column (gridx) positions.
Components are added to the panel one by one, with each label and text field pair on a new row.
Feel free to adjust the constraints or explore other layout managers based on your specific preferences and requirements.

It is placing elements at center of layout. Can it possible with Each line as Horizontal layout inside vertical layout?
ChatGPT
Certainly! If you want each label and text field pair to be horizontally aligned within a vertical layout, you can use nested layouts. In this case, you can use a BoxLayout for the main vertical layout and FlowLayout for each horizontal line. Here's how you can modify your code:

kotlin
Copy code
import javax.swing.*
import java.awt.*

class JumpLinesSettingPanel {

    val panel: JPanel
    private val numberOfLinesForwardTextField = JTextField()
    private val numberOfLinesBackwardTextField = JTextField()

    init {
        // Use BoxLayout for vertical stacking
        panel = JPanel()
        panel.layout = BoxLayout(panel, BoxLayout.Y_AXIS)

        // Add forward label and text field in the first row
        val forwardPanel = JPanel(FlowLayout(FlowLayout.LEFT))
        forwardPanel.add(JLabel("Number of lines to jump forward:"))
        forwardPanel.add(numberOfLinesForwardTextField)
        panel.add(forwardPanel)

        // Add backward label and text field in the second row
        val backwardPanel = JPanel(FlowLayout(FlowLayout.LEFT))
        backwardPanel.add(JLabel("Number of lines to jump backward:"))
        backwardPanel.add(numberOfLinesBackwardTextField)
        panel.add(backwardPanel)
    }
}
In this modification:

The main panel uses BoxLayout with BoxLayout.Y_AXIS to stack components vertically.
Each horizontal line is represented by a JPanel with FlowLayout(FlowLayout.LEFT), ensuring left alignment.
Each label and text field pair is added to its respective FlowLayout panel.
This way, you achieve a vertical stack of label and text field pairs, where each pair is horizontally aligned. Adjustments can be made based on your specific layout requirements.

I did this code to jump lines in forward direction.
class JumpForwardLines : AnAction() {

    override fun actionPerformed(e: AnActionEvent) {

        if (e.project == null)
            return

        val editor: Editor = e.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
        val document: Document = editor.document
        val caretModel: CaretModel = editor.caretModel
        val currentOffset: Int = caretModel.offset
        val scrollingModel: ScrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel

        val properties = PropertiesComponent.getInstance()
        val currentForwardNoOfLines = properties.getValue("JumpLines.NumberOfFLines", "4").toInt()

        // Calculate the new caret position
        val currentLineNumber: Int = document.getLineNumber(currentOffset)
        val newLineNumber: Int = currentLineNumber + currentForwardNoOfLines
        val currentColumn = currentOffset - document.getLineStartOffset(currentLineNumber)

        // Ensure the new line number is within valid bounds
        val validLineNumber: Int = newLineNumber.coerceIn(0, document.lineCount - 1)
        val newOffset: Int = document.getLineStartOffset(validLineNumber)
        caretModel.moveToOffset(newOffset)

        // Scrolling editor along with the cursor
        val newPosition = LogicalPosition(newLineNumber, currentColumn)
        caretModel.moveToLogicalPosition(newPosition)
        scrollingModel.scrollTo(newPosition, ScrollType.RELATIVE)
    }

    override fun update(e: AnActionEvent) {
        val project = e.project
        e.presentation.isEnabled = project != null
    }

    override fun getActionUpdateThread(): ActionUpdateThread {
        return ActionUpdateThread.EDT
    }
}

How do I make support the jumping with selection lines?
ChatGPT
To support jumping with selection lines in your JumpForwardLines action, you can modify the actionPerformed method to check for the selected text and adjust the caret position accordingly. If there is a selection, you can move the caret to the end of the selection; otherwise, you can proceed with the regular line jumping logic. Here's an updated version of your code:

kotlin
Copy code
class JumpForwardLines : AnAction() {

    override fun actionPerformed(e: AnActionEvent) {

        if (e.project == null)
            return

        val editor: Editor = e.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
        val document: Document = editor.document
        val caretModel: CaretModel = editor.caretModel
        val currentOffset: Int = caretModel.offset
        val scrollingModel: ScrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel

        // Check if there is a selection
        val selectedText = editor.selectionModel.selectedText

        if (selectedText != null) {
            // If there is a selection, move the caret to the end of the selection
            val selectionEndOffset = editor.selectionModel.selectionEnd
            caretModel.moveToOffset(selectionEndOffset)
        } else {
            // If no selection, proceed with regular line jumping logic

            val properties = PropertiesComponent.getInstance()
            val currentForwardNoOfLines = properties.getValue("JumpLines.NumberOfFLines", "4").toInt()

            // Calculate the new caret position
            val currentLineNumber: Int = document.getLineNumber(currentOffset)
            val newLineNumber: Int = currentLineNumber + currentForwardNoOfLines
            val currentColumn = currentOffset - document.getLineStartOffset(currentLineNumber)

            // Ensure the new line number is within valid bounds
            val validLineNumber: Int = newLineNumber.coerceIn(0, document.lineCount - 1)
            val newOffset: Int = document.getLineStartOffset(validLineNumber)
            caretModel.moveToOffset(newOffset)

            // Scrolling editor along with the cursor
            val newPosition = LogicalPosition(newLineNumber, currentColumn)
            caretModel.moveToLogicalPosition(newPosition)
            scrollingModel.scrollTo(newPosition, ScrollType.RELATIVE)
        }
    }

    override fun update(e: AnActionEvent) {
        val project = e.project
        e.presentation.isEnabled = project != null
    }

    override fun getActionUpdateThread(): ActionUpdateThread {
        return ActionUpdateThread.EDT
    }
}
In this modified version, the code checks if there is a selected text (selectedText). If there is, it moves the caret to the end of the selection. If there is no selection, it proceeds with the regular line jumping logic. This way, you support both scenarios in a single action.

This is not working properly. The cursor is not moving forward after the selected block.
ChatGPT
If the intention is to jump lines forward from the end of a selection block, and then optionally extend the selection to the new position, you might need to adjust the logic slightly. The original approach attempted to first check for a selection and then simply move the caret to the end of this selection, which doesn't align with the requirement.

To move the caret forward by a specified number of lines from its current position or the end of the selection block and then optionally extend the selection to the new position, you should calculate the new position based on either the caret's current position or the selection end, depending on whether text is selected. Here's an improved version:

java
Copy code
class JumpForwardLines : AnAction() {

    override fun actionPerformed(e: AnActionEvent) {

        val project = e.project ?: return
        val editor = e.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
        val document = editor.document
        val caretModel = editor.caretModel
        val scrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel
        val selectionModel = editor.selectionModel

        val properties = PropertiesComponent.getInstance(project)
        val jumpLines = properties.getValue("JumpLines.NumberOfFLines", "4").toInt()

        // Use either the current caret position or the end of the selection as the starting point
        val startPosition = if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) selectionModel.selectionEnd else caretModel.offset
        val startLineNumber = document.getLineNumber(startPosition)
        val targetLineNumber = (startLineNumber + jumpLines).coerceAtMost(document.lineCount - 1)

        // Calculate target offset
        val targetOffset = document.getLineStartOffset(targetLineNumber)
        caretModel.moveToOffset(targetOffset)
        scrollingModel.scrollToCaret(ScrollType.RELATIVE)

        // If there was a selection, extend it to the new position
        if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
            val startSelectionOffset = selectionModel.selectionStart
            // Adjust selection to new caret position
            selectionModel.setSelection(startSelectionOffset, caretModel.offset)
        }
    }

    override fun update(e: AnActionEvent) {
        val project = e.project
        e.presentation.isEnabled = project != null && e.getData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR) != null
    }

    override fun getActionUpdateThread(): ActionUpdateThread {
        return ActionUpdateThread.EDT
    }
}
This version does the following:

It calculates the starting point based on the caret's current position or the end of the selection.
It then calculates the target line number by adding the desired number of lines to jump.
The caret is moved to the start of the target line.
If there was a selection, it extends this selection to the new caret position.
Note: This code assumes you want to extend the selection from its original start to the new position after jumping lines. If you simply want to move the caret without altering the selection state, you can omit the selection extension logic.

The jumping is working as usual as before. I only want to jump lines with selection if there is a selected block otherwise jump the lines only.
ChatGPT
If you want your action to either jump lines with selection (if there's an existing selected block) or just jump lines (if there's no selection), you need to modify the logic to check whether text is selected and handle each case accordingly. Here's how you can adjust your JumpForwardLines action to achieve this:

java
Copy code
class JumpForwardLines : AnAction() {

    override fun actionPerformed(e: AnActionEvent) {

        val project = e.project ?: return
        val editor = e.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
        val document = editor.document
        val caretModel = editor.caretModel
        val scrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel
        val selectionModel = editor.selectionModel

        val properties = PropertiesComponent.getInstance(project)
        val jumpLines = properties.getValue("JumpLines.NumberOfFLines", "4").toInt()

        // Determine the current line and calculate the target line
        val currentOffset = if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) selectionModel.selectionEnd else caretModel.offset
        val currentLineNumber = document.getLineNumber(currentOffset)
        val targetLineNumber = (currentLineNumber + jumpLines).coerceAtMost(document.lineCount - 1)

        // Calculate the offset for the target line
        val targetOffset = document.getLineStartOffset(targetLineNumber) +
                (currentOffset - document.getLineStartOffset(currentLineNumber))

        // Move to the calculated offset
        caretModel.moveToOffset(targetOffset)
        scrollingModel.scrollToCaret(ScrollType.RELATIVE)

        // Extend the selection to the new position if there was a selection
        if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
            val startSelectionOffset = selectionModel.selectionStart
            selectionModel.setSelection(startSelectionOffset, caretModel.offset)
        }
    }

    override fun update(e: AnActionEvent) {
        val project = e.project
        e.presentation.isEnabled = project != null && e.getData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR) != null
    }

    override fun getActionUpdateThread(): ActionUpdateThread {
        return ActionUpdateThread.EDT
    }
}
This version of the JumpForwardLines action does the following:

It calculates the starting point for the jump based on either the end of the current selection (if any) or the caret's current position.
It computes the target line number by adding the desired number of lines to jump.
It moves the caret to the calculated offset on the target line.
If there was a selection, it extends the selection to include the new position.
With this approach, if there's a selected block, the action will jump lines from the end of the selection and extend the selection to the new position. If there's no selection, it simply jumps lines from the current caret position.

The jumping is working as usual as before. I only want to jump lines with selection if there is a selected block or lines otherwise jump the lines only.
ChatGPT
I apologize for any confusion. To achieve the behavior where jumping with lines should consider the selection if there's a selected block or jump lines only if there's no selection, you can modify the logic as follows:

kotlin
Copy code
class JumpForwardLines : AnAction() {

    override fun actionPerformed(e: AnActionEvent) {

        val project = e.project ?: return
        val editor = e.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
        val document = editor.document
        val caretModel = editor.caretModel
        val scrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel
        val selectionModel = editor.selectionModel

        val properties = PropertiesComponent.getInstance(project)
        val jumpLines = properties.getValue("JumpLines.NumberOfFLines", "4").toInt()

        val targetLineNumber = if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
            // If there's a selection, use the last line of the selection
            document.getLineNumber(selectionModel.selectionEnd)
        } else {
            // If there's no selection, use the current line
            document.getLineNumber(caretModel.offset)
        }

        // Calculate the offset for the target line
        val targetOffset = document.getLineStartOffset(targetLineNumber)

        // Move to the calculated offset
        caretModel.moveToOffset(targetOffset)
        scrollingModel.scrollToCaret(ScrollType.RELATIVE)

        // If there was a selection, extend it to the new position
        if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
            val startSelectionOffset = selectionModel.selectionStart
            selectionModel.setSelection(startSelectionOffset, caretModel.offset)
        }
    }

    override fun update(e: AnActionEvent) {
        val project = e.project
        e.presentation.isEnabled = project != null && e.getData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR) != null
    }

    override fun getActionUpdateThread(): ActionUpdateThread {
        return ActionUpdateThread.EDT
    }
}
This version of the JumpForwardLines action does the following:

It checks if there's a selection. If there is, it uses the last line of the selection as the target line; otherwise, it uses the current line of the caret.
It calculates the offset for the target line and moves the caret to that position.
If there was a selection, it extends the selection to include the new position.
Now, jumping with lines will consider the selection if there's a selected block or jump lines only if there's no selection.

The jumping is working as usual as before. I only want to jump lines with selection if there is a selected block or line otherwise jump the lines only.

I apologize for the confusion. To achieve the behavior where jumping lines should consider the selection if there's a selected block or line and jump lines only if there's no selection, you can modify the logic as follows:

        val project = e.project ?: return
        val editor = e.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
        val document = editor.document
        val caretModel = editor.caretModel
        val scrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel
        val selectionModel = editor.selectionModel

        val properties = PropertiesComponent.getInstance(project)
        val jumpLines = properties.getValue("JumpLines.NumberOfFLines", "4").toInt()

        val targetLineNumber = when {
            // If there's a selection, use the last line of the selection
            selectionModel.hasSelection() -> document.getLineNumber(selectionModel.selectionEnd)
            // If there's no selection, use the current line
            else -> document.getLineNumber(caretModel.offset)
        }

        // Calculate the offset for the target line
        val targetOffset = document.getLineStartOffset(targetLineNumber)

        // Move to the calculated offset
        caretModel.moveToOffset(targetOffset)
        scrollingModel.scrollToCaret(ScrollType.RELATIVE)

        // If there was a selection, extend it to the new position
        if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
            val startSelectionOffset = selectionModel.selectionStart
            selectionModel.setSelection(startSelectionOffset, caretModel.offset)
        }
    }

    override fun update(e: AnActionEvent) {
        val project = e.project
        e.presentation.isEnabled = project != null && e.getData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR) != null
    }

    override fun getActionUpdateThread(): ActionUpdateThread {
        return ActionUpdateThread.EDT
    }
}
This version of the JumpForwardLines action checks whether there is a selection. If there is, it uses the last line of the selection as the target line; otherwise, it uses the current line of the caret. The subsequent logic remains the same, moving the caret to the calculated offset and extending the selection if necessary.

Now, jumping lines will consider the selection if there's a selected block or line, and it will jump lines only if there's no selection.

This is not working. Please understand that Jumping is working properly. I have only requirement that If I have to jump the lines and if that line is selected then jump with selection.
ChatGPT
I apologize for any confusion. If your goal is to jump lines and, if the line being jumped to is already selected, extend the selection, here's a simplified version of your action:

kotlin
Copy code
class JumpForwardLines : AnAction() {

    override fun actionPerformed(e: AnActionEvent) {

        val project = e.project ?: return
        val editor = e.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
        val caretModel = editor.caretModel
        val document = editor.document
        val selectionModel = editor.selectionModel
        val scrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel

        val properties = PropertiesComponent.getInstance(project)
        val jumpLines = properties.getValue("JumpLines.NumberOfFLines", "4").toInt()

        // Get the current caret position
        val currentLineNumber = document.getLineNumber(caretModel.offset)

        // Calculate the target line number
        val targetLineNumber = (currentLineNumber + jumpLines).coerceAtMost(document.lineCount - 1)

        // Calculate the target offset
        val targetOffset = document.getLineStartOffset(targetLineNumber)

        // Move the caret to the calculated offset
        caretModel.moveToOffset(targetOffset)

        // If the target line is already selected, extend the selection
        if (selectionModel.isSelected(targetOffset)) {
            val startSelectionOffset = selectionModel.selectionStart
            selectionModel.setSelection(startSelectionOffset, caretModel.offset)
        }

        // Scroll to the caret position
        scrollingModel.scrollToCaret(ScrollType.RELATIVE)
    }

    override fun update(e: AnActionEvent) {
        val project = e.project
        e.presentation.isEnabled = project != null && e.getData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR) != null
    }

    override fun getActionUpdateThread(): ActionUpdateThread {
        return ActionUpdateThread.EDT
    }
}
This version of the JumpForwardLines action calculates the target line number and offset, moves the caret to the calculated offset, and then checks if the target line is selected. If it is, it extends the selection to include the new position. This should fulfill your requirement of jumping lines and, if the line being jumped to is already selected, extending the selection.

There is no method isSelected for selectionModel. But anyway I made it work by .hasSelection() method. Now tell me how to perform the same on backward direction?
ChatGPT
I apologize for the oversight, and I'm glad you were able to make it work using the hasSelection() method.

To perform the same action in the backward direction, you can modify the action to move lines backward instead. Here's an updated version for jumping lines backward:

kotlin
Copy code
class JumpBackwardLines : AnAction() {

    override fun actionPerformed(e: AnActionEvent) {

        val project = e.project ?: return
        val editor = e.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
        val caretModel = editor.caretModel
        val document = editor.document
        val selectionModel = editor.selectionModel
        val scrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel

        val properties = PropertiesComponent.getInstance(project)
        val jumpLines = properties.getValue("JumpLines.NumberOfBLines", "4").toInt()

        // Get the current caret position
        val currentLineNumber = document.getLineNumber(caretModel.offset)

        // Calculate the target line number
        val targetLineNumber = (currentLineNumber - jumpLines).coerceAtLeast(0)

        // Calculate the target offset
        val targetOffset = document.getLineStartOffset(targetLineNumber)

        // Move the caret to the calculated offset
        caretModel.moveToOffset(targetOffset)

        // If the target line is already selected, extend the selection
        if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
            val startSelectionOffset = selectionModel.selectionStart
            selectionModel.setSelection(startSelectionOffset, caretModel.offset)
        }

        // Scroll to the caret position
        scrollingModel.scrollToCaret(ScrollType.RELATIVE)
    }

    override fun update(e: AnActionEvent) {
        val project = e.project
        e.presentation.isEnabled = project != null && e.getData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR) != null
    }

    override fun getActionUpdateThread(): ActionUpdateThread {
        return ActionUpdateThread.EDT
    }
}
This JumpBackwardLines action calculates the target line and offset for jumping lines backward, moves the caret to the calculated offset, and extends the selection if the target line is already selected. Please adjust the jumpLines value accordingly to control the number of lines to jump backward.

This is my code of actionPerformed() of BackwardLines.kt:
    override fun actionPerformed(e: AnActionEvent) {

        if (e.project == null)
            return

        val editor: Editor = e.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
        val document: Document = editor.document
        val caretModel: CaretModel = editor.caretModel
        val currentOffset: Int = caretModel.offset
        val scrollingModel: ScrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel
        val selectionModel: SelectionModel = editor.selectionModel

        val properties = PropertiesComponent.getInstance()
        val currentForwardNoOfLines = properties.getValue("JumpLines.NumberOfBLines", "2").toInt()

        // Calculate the new caret position
        val currentLineNumber: Int = document.getLineNumber(currentOffset)
        val newLineNumber: Int =
            when {
                currentLineNumber + currentForwardNoOfLines < 0 -> 0
                else -> currentLineNumber + (-currentForwardNoOfLines)
            }
        val currentColumn = currentOffset - document.getLineStartOffset(currentLineNumber)

        // Ensure the new line number is within valid bounds
        val validLineNumber: Int = newLineNumber.coerceIn(0, document.lineCount - 1)
        val newOffset: Int = document.getLineStartOffset(validLineNumber)
        caretModel.moveToOffset(newOffset)

        // Scrolling editor along with the cursor
        val newPosition = LogicalPosition(validLineNumber, currentColumn)
        caretModel.moveToLogicalPosition(newPosition)

        // If the target line is already selected, extend the selection
        if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
            val startSelectionOffset = selectionModel.selectionStart
            selectionModel.setSelection(startSelectionOffset, caretModel.offset)
        }

        scrollingModel.scrollTo(newPosition, ScrollType.RELATIVE)
    }
ChatGPT
Your actionPerformed method for jumping lines backward looks correct. It calculates the new caret position based on the number of lines to jump backward, ensures the new position is within valid bounds, and then moves the caret to that position. It also extends the selection if there's already a selection.

If you're facing any specific issues or if there's something specific you'd like assistance with, please provide more details, and I'll do my best to help.

Consider the case where there are 6 lines. I selected 6th line and jumped two lines backward. Now 6th and 5th line is selected. But when I again jump two more lines backward, 3rd and 4th lines are selecting and 6th and 5th are excluded from the selected block.
ChatGPT
Thank you for providing more details. The behavior you're describing is expected based on how you're handling the selection. When you jump lines backward, you're moving the caret to a new position, and if there was an existing selection, you're extending the selection to include the new position.

However, the behavior you want is to preserve the initial selection (including the 6th line) and extend it further backward as you jump lines. To achieve this, you need to remember the initial selection position and use that as the starting point for extending the selection each time you jump backward.

Here's a modified version of your actionPerformed method to achieve the desired behavior:

kotlin
Copy code
class JumpBackwardLines : AnAction() {

    override fun actionPerformed(e: AnActionEvent) {

        if (e.project == null)
            return

        val editor: Editor = e.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
        val document: Document = editor.document
        val caretModel: CaretModel = editor.caretModel
        val scrollingModel: ScrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel
        val selectionModel: SelectionModel = editor.selectionModel

        val properties = PropertiesComponent.getInstance()
        val currentForwardNoOfLines = properties.getValue("JumpLines.NumberOfBLines", "2").toInt()

        // Calculate the new caret position
        val currentLineNumber: Int = document.getLineNumber(caretModel.offset)

        // If there's a selection, use the start position of the selection; otherwise, use the current position
        val startPosition: Int = if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) selectionModel.selectionStart else caretModel.offset

        // Calculate the new line number
        val newLineNumber: Int =
            when {
                currentLineNumber - currentForwardNoOfLines < 0 -> 0
                else -> currentLineNumber - currentForwardNoOfLines
            }

        val currentColumn = caretModel.logicalPosition.column

        // Ensure the new line number is within valid bounds
        val validLineNumber: Int = newLineNumber.coerceIn(0, document.lineCount - 1)
        val newOffset: Int = document.getLineStartOffset(validLineNumber)

        caretModel.moveToOffset(newOffset)

        // Scrolling editor along with the cursor
        val newPosition = LogicalPosition(validLineNumber, currentColumn)
        caretModel.moveToLogicalPosition(newPosition)

        // If there was a selection, extend it from the start position to the new position
        if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
            selectionModel.setSelection(startPosition, caretModel.offset)
        }

        scrollingModel.scrollTo(newPosition, ScrollType.RELATIVE)
    }
}
In this version, the key change is using the startPosition variable to remember the initial selection start position. If there's a selection, it starts the extension from this remembered position, ensuring that the entire selection is preserved as you jump lines backward.

Here is my code changes which still cannot working as desired:
    override fun actionPerformed(e: AnActionEvent) {

        if (e.project == null)
            return

        val editor: Editor = e.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
        val document: Document = editor.document
        val caretModel: CaretModel = editor.caretModel
        val selectionModel: SelectionModel = editor.selectionModel
        val currentOffset: Int = if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) selectionModel.selectionStart else caretModel.offset
        val scrollingModel: ScrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel

        val properties = PropertiesComponent.getInstance()
        val currentForwardNoOfLines = properties.getValue("JumpLines.NumberOfBLines", "2").toInt()

        // Calculate the new caret position
        val currentLineNumber: Int = document.getLineNumber(currentOffset)
        val newLineNumber: Int =
            when {
                currentLineNumber + currentForwardNoOfLines < 0 -> 0
                else -> currentLineNumber + (-currentForwardNoOfLines)
            }
        val currentColumn = currentOffset - document.getLineStartOffset(currentLineNumber)

        // Ensure the new line number is within valid bounds
        val validLineNumber: Int = newLineNumber.coerceIn(0, document.lineCount - 1)
        val newOffset: Int = document.getLineStartOffset(validLineNumber)
        caretModel.moveToOffset(newOffset)

        // Scrolling editor along with the cursor
        val newPosition = LogicalPosition(validLineNumber, currentColumn)
        caretModel.moveToLogicalPosition(newPosition)

        // If the target line is already selected, extend the selection
        if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
            val startSelectionOffset = selectionModel.selectionStart
            selectionModel.setSelection(startSelectionOffset, caretModel.offset)
        }

        scrollingModel.scrollTo(newPosition, ScrollType.RELATIVE)
    }
ChatGPT
Thank you for providing the updated code. I see the issue now. The problem is that each time you jump backward, you're extending the selection from its start to the new caret position. This causes the behavior where the previous selection gets replaced.

To achieve the desired behavior of preserving the initial selection while extending it backward, you need to update the start of the selection each time you jump backward. Here's the modified code:

kotlin
Copy code
class JumpBackwardLines : AnAction() {

    override fun actionPerformed(e: AnActionEvent) {

        if (e.project == null)
            return

        val editor: Editor = e.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
        val document: Document = editor.document
        val caretModel: CaretModel = editor.caretModel
        val selectionModel: SelectionModel = editor.selectionModel
        val scrollingModel: ScrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel

        val properties = PropertiesComponent.getInstance()
        val currentForwardNoOfLines = properties.getValue("JumpLines.NumberOfBLines", "2").toInt()

        // Calculate the new caret position
        val currentLineNumber: Int = document.getLineNumber(caretModel.offset)
        val newLineNumber: Int =
            when {
                currentLineNumber - currentForwardNoOfLines < 0 -> 0
                else -> currentLineNumber - currentForwardNoOfLines
            }
        val currentColumn = caretModel.logicalPosition.column

        // Ensure the new line number is within valid bounds
        val validLineNumber: Int = newLineNumber.coerceIn(0, document.lineCount - 1)
        val newOffset: Int = document.getLineStartOffset(validLineNumber)
        caretModel.moveToOffset(newOffset)

        // Scrolling editor along with the cursor
        val newPosition = LogicalPosition(validLineNumber, currentColumn)
        caretModel.moveToLogicalPosition(newPosition)

        // If there was a selection, update the start of the selection
        if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
            selectionModel.setSelectionStart(caretModel.offset)
        }

        scrollingModel.scrollTo(newPosition, ScrollType.RELATIVE)
    }
}
In this version, instead of extending the selection each time, it updates the start of the selection (setSelectionStart) to the current caret position. This way, the selection is preserved, and you can keep extending it backward with each jump.

I can't get it.
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. It seems there might be some misunderstanding. Let's simplify the code for jumping backward while preserving the selection:

kotlin
Copy code
class JumpBackwardLines : AnAction() {

    override fun actionPerformed(e: AnActionEvent) {
        val editor: Editor = e.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
        val caretModel: CaretModel = editor.caretModel
        val selectionModel: SelectionModel = editor.selectionModel
        val document: Document = editor.document

        val currentLineNumber: Int = document.getLineNumber(caretModel.offset)
        val backwardNoOfLines = 2  // Adjust this as needed

        // Calculate the new line number
        val newLineNumber = maxOf(0, currentLineNumber - backwardNoOfLines)

        // Calculate the new offset
        val newOffset = document.getLineStartOffset(newLineNumber)

        // Move the caret to the new position
        caretModel.moveToOffset(newOffset)

        // If there's a selection, update the selection end
        if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
            selectionModel.setSelectionEnd(caretModel.offset)
        }
    }
}
This code snippet calculates the new caret position by moving backward a specified number of lines (backwardNoOfLines). If there's a selection, it updates the selection's end position, preserving the initial selection while extending it backward.

Please replace the backwardNoOfLines variable with the number of lines you want to jump backward. Adjust this value according to your requirements. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask.

there is no method exists like .setSelectionEnd().
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion in my previous messages. You are correct, and I appreciate your patience.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

kotlin
Copy code
class JumpBackwardLines : AnAction() {

    override fun actionPerformed(e: AnActionEvent) {
        val editor: Editor = e.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
        val caretModel: CaretModel = editor.caretModel
        val selectionModel: SelectionModel = editor.selectionModel
        val document: Document = editor.document

        val currentLineNumber: Int = document.getLineNumber(caretModel.offset)
        val backwardNoOfLines = 2  // Adjust this as needed

        // Calculate the new line number
        val newLineNumber = maxOf(0, currentLineNumber - backwardNoOfLines)

        // Calculate the new offset
        val newOffset = document.getLineStartOffset(newLineNumber)

        // If there's a selection, adjust the selection
        if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
            val startOffset = selectionModel.selectionStart
            val endOffset = caretModel.offset
            val newStartOffset = maxOf(newOffset, minOf(startOffset, endOffset))
            val newEndOffset = maxOf(newOffset, minOf(startOffset, endOffset))

            selectionModel.setSelection(newStartOffset, newEndOffset)
        }

        // Move the caret to the new position
        caretModel.moveToOffset(newOffset)
    }
}
This version adjusts the selection based on the new caret position. It calculates a new start and end offset for the selection, ensuring that it covers the new position while preserving the initial selection.

I appreciate your understanding, and I hope this resolves the issue. If you have further questions or need more assistance, feel free to ask.

The selection is only extending if there is a selection, otherwise only the cursor is jumping.

ChatGPT
Thank you for providing the updated code. It seems like you are extending the selection after moving the caret position. To preserve the selection, you should adjust the selection logic to extend the selection only if there is an existing selection.

Here's the corrected code:

kotlin
Copy code
override fun actionPerformed(event: AnActionEvent) {

    event.project ?: return

    val editor: Editor = event.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
    val document: Document = editor.document
    val caretModel: CaretModel = editor.caretModel
    val currentOffset: Int = caretModel.offset
    val scrollingModel: ScrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel
    val selectionModel: SelectionModel = editor.selectionModel

    val properties = PropertiesComponent.getInstance()
    val currentForwardNoOfLines = properties.getValue("JumpLines.NumberOfBLines", "2").toInt()

    // Calculate the new caret position
    val currentLineNumber: Int = document.getLineNumber(currentOffset)
    val newLineNumber: Int =
        when {
            currentLineNumber + currentForwardNoOfLines < 0 -> 0
            else -> currentLineNumber + (-currentForwardNoOfLines)
        }
    val currentColumn = currentOffset - document.getLineStartOffset(currentLineNumber)

    // Ensure the new line number is within valid bounds
    val validLineNumber: Int = newLineNumber.coerceIn(0, document.lineCount - 1)
    val newOffset: Int = document.getLineStartOffset(validLineNumber)
    caretModel.moveToOffset(newOffset)

    // Scrolling editor along with the cursor
    val newPosition = LogicalPosition(validLineNumber, currentColumn)
    caretModel.moveToLogicalPosition(newPosition)

    // Extend the selection if there is an existing selection
    if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
        val startSelectionOffset = selectionModel.selectionStart
        selectionModel.setSelection(startSelectionOffset, caretModel.offset)
    }

    scrollingModel.scrollTo(newPosition, ScrollType.RELATIVE)
}
This version checks whether there is an existing selection using selectionModel.hasSelection() before extending the selection. If there's no existing selection, it only moves the caret without extending the selection.

I want to start jumping by selecting. Don't want to start only if there is selection.
ChatGPT
Understood. If you want to start the jump operation by selecting (regardless of whether there's an existing selection), you can modify the logic. Here's the updated code:

kotlin
Copy code
override fun actionPerformed(event: AnActionEvent) {

    event.project ?: return

    val editor: Editor = event.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
    val document: Document = editor.document
    val caretModel: CaretModel = editor.caretModel
    val currentOffset: Int = caretModel.offset
    val scrollingModel: ScrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel
    val selectionModel: SelectionModel = editor.selectionModel

    val properties = PropertiesComponent.getInstance()
    val currentForwardNoOfLines = properties.getValue("JumpLines.NumberOfBLines", "2").toInt()

    // If there is a selection, start from the beginning of the selection; otherwise, start from the current caret position
    val startOffset: Int = if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) selectionModel.selectionStart else currentOffset

    // Calculate the new caret position
    val currentLineNumber: Int = document.getLineNumber(startOffset)
    val newLineNumber: Int =
        when {
            currentLineNumber + currentForwardNoOfLines < 0 -> 0
            else -> currentLineNumber + (-currentForwardNoOfLines)
        }
    val currentColumn = startOffset - document.getLineStartOffset(currentLineNumber)

    // Ensure the new line number is within valid bounds
    val validLineNumber: Int = newLineNumber.coerceIn(0, document.lineCount - 1)
    val newOffset: Int = document.getLineStartOffset(validLineNumber)
    caretModel.moveToOffset(newOffset)

    // Scrolling editor along with the cursor
    val newPosition = LogicalPosition(validLineNumber, currentColumn)
    caretModel.moveToLogicalPosition(newPosition)

    // Extend the selection if there is an existing selection
    if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
        selectionModel.setSelection(startOffset, caretModel.offset)
    }

    scrollingModel.scrollTo(newPosition, ScrollType.RELATIVE)
}
This version starts the jump operation from the beginning of the selection if there is one. If there's no existing selection, it starts from the current caret position. The selection is then extended from the start offset to the new caret position.

        caretModel.moveToLogicalPosition(newPosition)

        scrollingModel.scrollTo(newPosition, ScrollType.RELATIVE)
    }
ChatGPT
It seems there is an issue in calculating the currentColumn. The error is likely due to a negative value being passed to LogicalPosition, which expects a non-negative column value.

Replace this line:

kotlin
Copy code
val currentColumn = startOffset - document.getLineStartOffset(abs(currentLineNumber))
with:

kotlin
Copy code
val currentColumn = startOffset - document.getLineStartOffset(currentLineNumber)
This should resolve the issue by calculating the currentColumn as the difference between startOffset and the start offset of the current line. The abs function is not needed in this context.

Here is the corrected code snippet:

kotlin
Copy code
val currentColumn = startOffset - document.getLineStartOffset(currentLineNumber)
Make this change and see if it resolves the IllegalArgumentException. If you encounter any further issues or have additional questions, feel free to ask.

        scrollingModel.scrollTo(newPosition, ScrollType.RELATIVE)
    }

I apologize for the oversight. It seems the issue is with the calculation of the currentColumn. You should calculate it based on the startOffset and the start offset of the line where the caret is located.

Replace this line:

kotlin
Copy code
val currentColumn = startOffset - document.getLineStartOffset(abs(currentLineNumber))
with:

kotlin
Copy code
val currentColumn = startOffset - document.getLineStartOffset(currentLineNumber)
Here's the corrected snippet:

kotlin
Copy code
val currentColumn = startOffset - document.getLineStartOffset(currentLineNumber)
This should resolve the IllegalArgumentException. Ensure that you make this change and check if the issue persists. If you encounter any further problems or have additional questions, feel free to ask.

Getting exception:
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: column must be non negative: -102

        // Calculate the new caret position
        val currentLineNumber: Int = document.getLineNumber(currentOffset)
        val newLineNumber: Int = currentLineNumber + currentForwardNoOfLines
        val currentColumn = startOffset - document.getLineStartOffset(abs(currentLineNumber))

        // Ensure the new line number is within valid bounds
        val validLineNumber: Int = newLineNumber.coerceIn(0, document.lineCount - 1)
        val newOffset: Int = document.getLineStartOffset(validLineNumber)
        caretModel.moveToOffset(newOffset)

        // extend the selection
        selectionModel.setSelection(startOffset, caretModel.offset)

        // Scrolling editor along with the cursor
        val newPosition = LogicalPosition(newLineNumber, currentColumn)
        caretModel.moveToLogicalPosition(newPosition)

        scrollingModel.scrollTo(newPosition, ScrollType.RELATIVE)
    }
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. It seems there is still an issue with the calculation of the currentColumn. If you are trying to calculate the column offset within the line, you should use the difference between the startOffset and the start offset of the line where the caret is located.

Replace this line:

kotlin
Copy code
val currentColumn = startOffset - document.getLineStartOffset(abs(currentLineNumber))
with:

kotlin
Copy code
val currentColumn = startOffset - document.getLineStartOffset(currentLineNumber)
Here's the corrected snippet:

kotlin
Copy code
val currentColumn = startOffset - document.getLineStartOffset(currentLineNumber)
If the issue persists, please double-check the calculations and ensure that the startOffset and currentLineNumber values are correct. If the problem continues, you might want to print these values for debugging purposes.

kotlin
Copy code
println("startOffset: $startOffset, currentLineNumber: $currentLineNumber")
This will help you inspect the values during runtime and identify any discrepancies. If you still face issues, feel free to share more details, and I'll do my best to assist you.

I have resolved it. How do I move cursor to a middle line? i.e. the topmost line is 10 and the lowermost line is 37 then cursor should move to line 23 (Average of both).
There is no property 'startOffset', 'endOffset' for visibleArea.
There are no method 'visibleArea.startLine' and 'visiblArea.endLine' too.
ChatGPT
I see, if you want to move the cursor to a specific line in the middle of the visible area, you can use the ScrollingModel to determine the visible area and then calculate the middle line. Here's an example in Kotlin:

kotlin
Copy code
val scrollingModel: ScrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel

// Get the visible area
val visibleArea = scrollingModel.visibleArea

// Calculate the middle line
val middleLine = (visibleArea.startLine + visibleArea.endLine) / 2

// Move the cursor to the middle line
editor.caretModel.primaryCaret.moveToLogicalPosition(LogicalPosition(middleLine, 0))
This code calculates the middle line number by averaging the startLine and endLine of the visible area, then moves the primary caret to that middle line using moveToLogicalPosition.

Make sure you call this code at an appropriate time, such as in a listener reacting to user actions or in the appropriate part of your plugin logic.

I can't get this line:         val middleLineNumber = visibleArea
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. It seems there was a mistake in my previous response. I appreciate your patience.

To get the middle line number from the visibleArea, you can calculate it as follows:

kotlin
Copy code
val scrollingModel: ScrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel

// Get the visible area
val visibleArea = scrollingModel.visibleArea

// Calculate the middle line
val middleLine = (visibleArea.startOffset + visibleArea.endOffset) / 2
val middleLineNumber = editor.document.getLineNumber(middleLine)

// Move the cursor to the middle line
editor.caretModel.primaryCaret.moveToLogicalPosition(LogicalPosition(middleLineNumber, 0))
This code calculates the middleLine as the average of startOffset and endOffset, converts it to a line number using getLineNumber, and then moves the primary caret to that middle line using moveToLogicalPosition.

I appreciate your understanding, and I hope this resolves the issue. If you have further questions or encounter any problems, feel free to ask.

But there is no method '.startOffset' and '.endOffset' of visibleArea.
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion. You're correct; there is no startOffset and endOffset in the visibleArea. I appreciate your patience.

If you want to move the cursor to the middle of the visible area, you can directly use the startLine and endLine properties of the visibleArea. Here's the corrected code:

kotlin
Copy code
val scrollingModel: ScrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel

// Get the visible area
val visibleArea = scrollingModel.visibleArea

// Calculate the middle line
val middleLine = (visibleArea.startLine + visibleArea.endLine) / 2

// Move the cursor to the middle line
editor.caretModel.primaryCaret.moveToLogicalPosition(LogicalPosition(middleLine, 0))
This code calculates the middleLine as the average of startLine and endLine directly from the visibleArea and then moves the primary caret to that middle line using moveToLogicalPosition.

I appreciate your understanding, and I hope this resolves the issue. If you have further questions or encounter any problems, feel free to ask.

Is there any other way? because visibleArea has this methods:
@NotNull Rectangle getVisibleArea();

    @NotNull Rectangle getVisibleAreaOnScrollingFinished();

    void scrollToCaret(@NotNull ScrollType var1);

    void scrollTo(@NotNull LogicalPosition var1, @NotNull ScrollType var2);

    void runActionOnScrollingFinished(@NotNull Runnable var1);

    void disableAnimation();

    void enableAnimation();

    int getVerticalScrollOffset();

    int getHorizontalScrollOffset();

    void scrollVertically(int var1);

    void scrollHorizontally(int var1);

    void scroll(int var1, int var2);

    void addVisibleAreaListener(@NotNull VisibleAreaListener var1);

    void removeVisibleAreaListener(@NotNull VisibleAreaListener var1);

    default void addVisibleAreaListener(@NotNull VisibleAreaListener listener, @NotNull Disposable disposable) {
        if (listener == null) {
            $$$reportNull$$$0(0);
        }

        if (disposable == null) {
            $$$reportNull$$$0(1);
        }

        this.addVisibleAreaListener(listener);
        Disposer.register(disposable, () -> {
            this.removeVisibleAreaListener(listener);
        });
    }

    public interface ScrollingHelper {
        @NotNull Point calculateScrollingLocation(@NotNull Editor var1, @NotNull VisualPosition var2);

        @NotNull Point calculateScrollingLocation(@NotNull Editor var1, @NotNull LogicalPosition var2);
    }
ChatGPT
Given the actual methods available in the ScrollingModel and the need to move the cursor to the middle line of the visible area in an IntelliJ Platform-based editor, you would approach it differently since startLine and endLine are not directly available properties.

To calculate the middle line of the visible area, you can use the vertical scroll offset and the editor's line height to determine which lines are at the top and bottom of the visible area, then calculate the middle line from that. Here's how you could do it:

kotlin
Copy code
val editor: Editor = event.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
val scrollingModel: ScrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel
val document: Document = editor.document

// Get vertical scroll offset and editor's line height
val verticalScrollOffset = scrollingModel.verticalScrollOffset
val lineHeight = editor.lineHeight

// Calculate the first visible line
val firstVisibleLine = verticalScrollOffset / lineHeight

// Calculate the number of visible lines in the editor's visible area
val visibleAreaHeight = scrollingModel.visibleArea.height
val visibleLineCount = visibleAreaHeight / lineHeight

// Calculate the last visible line
val lastVisibleLine = firstVisibleLine + visibleLineCount

// Calculate the middle visible line
val middleVisibleLine = (firstVisibleLine + lastVisibleLine) / 2

// Move the cursor to the calculated middle line, considering to stay within document bounds
val middleLineOffset = document.getLineStartOffset(middleVisibleLine.coerceIn(0, document.lineCount - 1))
editor.caretModel.moveToOffset(middleLineOffset)

// Optionally, scroll to the new caret position to ensure it's centered
scrollingModel.scrollToCaret(ScrollType.CENTER)
This code calculates the first and last visible lines based on the vertical scroll offset and the line height, then finds the middle line within the visible area. It moves the caret to the start of this middle line and scrolls to make sure the caret is visible and ideally centered. Note that this approach assumes a uniform line height for simplicity.

Everything is working properly but when I accidently applied keymap on Find or Replace dialog, it is generating exception: "java.lang.AssertionError: editor is missing"
ChatGPT
The exception "java.lang.AssertionError: editor is missing" typically occurs when an action is executed that expects an editor instance, but no editor is available at that moment. This can happen if an action is triggered when the focus is not on an editor component or if the editor component has been disposed.

To prevent this exception, you can add a check to ensure that an editor instance is available before performing actions that depend on it. For example:

kotlin
Copy code
override fun actionPerformed(event: AnActionEvent) {
    val editor: Editor = event.getData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR) ?: return

    // Perform actions that depend on the editor
}
This code snippet checks if an editor instance is available using event.getData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR). If the editor is null, it simply returns early without executing further actions, which can help prevent the "editor is missing" assertion error.

Make sure to add this check to any action handler that relies on having an editor instance. This can help avoid unexpected exceptions and ensure a smoother user experience.

Now it not given exception message. Only gives "java.lang.AssertionError"
ChatGPT
If you're still encountering a java.lang.AssertionError without additional information, it indicates that the program encountered an unexpected condition or state at runtime.

To diagnose the issue further, you'll need to determine the specific cause of the assertion error. Here are some steps you can take to investigate:

Check the stack trace: Look at the full stack trace of the AssertionError to see if there are any additional details or hints about what might have caused the error.

Debugging: Try debugging the code to understand the flow of execution leading up to the error. Set breakpoints and step through the code to identify where the assertion is failing.

Logging: Add logging statements at critical points in your code to track the program's execution. Log information such as variable values, method calls, and control flow to help pinpoint the issue.

Review code changes: If the error started occurring after making changes to your code, review those changes carefully to identify any potential causes of the assertion error.

Reproduce the issue: Try to reproduce the error consistently using a specific sequence of actions or inputs. This can help you understand the conditions that trigger the assertion error.

By following these steps and investigating the specific circumstances surrounding the assertion error, you should be able to identify the root cause and address it accordingly.

Okay. I handled the exception by wrapping under try..catch block. How can I make toast for the exception message?
ChatGPT
To display a toast for the exception message in an Android application, you can use the Toast class. Here's an example of how you can catch the exception and display its message as a toast:

kotlin
Copy code
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (e: Exception) {
    // Handle the exception
    val errorMessage = e.message ?: "An error occurred"
    showToast(errorMessage)
}

fun showToast(message: String) {
    Toast.makeText(applicationContext, message, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
}
In this example:

The try block contains the code that may throw an exception.

Inside the catch block, the exception is caught (e: Exception) and its message is retrieved using e.message. If the exception message is null, a default message is used.

The showToast function is called with the error message as an argument. This function creates and displays a toast with the specified message.

Make sure to replace applicationContext with the appropriate context if you're calling showToast from a different context, such as an activity or fragment.

By using this approach, you can display informative toast messages for exceptions that occur in your application.

I am not telling for the android application. I'm talking about Toasting on jetbrains IDE.
ChatGPT
I see, you want to display a toast message in the JetBrains IDE. JetBrains IDEs don't have a built-in toast mechanism like Android. However, you can achieve similar functionality by using a notification balloon.

Here's how you can display a notification balloon with an exception message in a JetBrains IDE plugin:

kotlin
Copy code
import com.intellij.notification.Notification
import com.intellij.notification.NotificationType
import com.intellij.notification.Notifications

try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (e: Exception) {
    // Handle the exception
    val errorMessage = e.message ?: "An error occurred"
    showNotification(errorMessage)
}

fun showNotification(message: String) {
    val notification = Notification(
        "YourPluginId", // The ID of your plugin
        "Error", // The title of the notification
        message, // The content of the notification
        NotificationType.ERROR // The notification type (ERROR, WARNING, INFORMATION, etc.)
    )
    Notifications.Bus.notify(notification)
}
In this example:

The try block contains the code that may throw an exception.

Inside the catch block, the exception is caught (e: Exception) and its message is retrieved using e.message. If the exception message is null, a default message is used.

The showNotification function is called with the error message as an argument. This function creates and displays a notification balloon with the specified message, using the Notification class and the Notifications.Bus.notify method.

Make sure to replace "YourPluginId" with the ID of your plugin.

By using this approach, you can display error messages in a notification balloon within the JetBrains IDE.

Give an example of groupId. Because it is giving compile time error that cannot resolve notification groupId 'Error'.
ChatGPT
My apologies for the confusion. The groupId in the Notification constructor refers to a unique identifier for the notification group. Here's how you can define and use a groupId:

kotlin
Copy code
import com.intellij.notification.Notification
import com.intellij.notification.NotificationGroup
import com.intellij.notification.NotificationType
import com.intellij.notification.Notifications

// Define a notification group
val notificationGroup = NotificationGroup("YourPluginId", NotificationDisplayType.BALLOON, true)

try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
} catch (e: Exception) {
    // Handle the exception
    val errorMessage = e.message ?: "An error occurred"
    showNotification(errorMessage)
}

fun showNotification(message: String) {
    // Create a notification with the specified message and notification group
    val notification = notificationGroup.createNotification(
        "Error", // The title of the notification
        message, // The content of the notification
        NotificationType.ERROR // The notification type (ERROR, WARNING, INFORMATION, etc.)
    )
    Notifications.Bus.notify(notification)
}
In this example:

We define a notification group using NotificationGroup. You can specify your plugin ID as the groupId.

We create a notification using the createNotification method of the notification group, passing the title, message, and notification type.

We use Notifications.Bus.notify(notification) to display the notification.

Make sure to replace "YourPluginId" with the ID of your plugin.

By using this approach, you can display error messages in a notification balloon within the JetBrains IDE.

Working as expected. Thanks a lot...... :)
ChatGPT
You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask. Happy coding! :)

I have one of the functionality to jump on middle line of an editor. The code is given below. The cursor jumps on middle line as expected if there is no code folds. Otherwise it expand the folded block if the calculated middle line inside the folded range.
Code:
			val editor: Editor = event.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
			val scrollingModel: ScrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel
			val selectionModel: SelectionModel = editor.selectionModel
			val document: Document = editor.document

			// Get vertical scroll offset and line height of editor
			val verticalScrollOffset = scrollingModel.verticalScrollOffset
			val lineHeight = editor.lineHeight

			// Calculate the first visible line
			val firstVisibleLine = verticalScrollOffset / lineHeight

			// Calculate the number of visible lines in the editor's visible area
			val visibleAreaHeight = scrollingModel.visibleArea.height
			val visibleLineCount = visibleAreaHeight / lineHeight

			val lastVisibleLine = firstVisibleLine + visibleLineCount

			// Calculate the middle visible line
			val middleVisibleLine = (firstVisibleLine + lastVisibleLine) / 2

			// Move the cursor to the calculated middle line, considering to stay within document bounds
			val middleLineOffset = document.getLineStartOffset(middleVisibleLine.coerceIn(0, document.lineCount - 1))
			editor.caretModel.moveToOffset(middleLineOffset)

			// Remove selection blocks before jumping
			if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
				selectionModel.removeSelection(/* allCarets = */ true)
			}
ChatGPT
Your code looks good for jumping to the middle line of the editor. However, if there are folded code blocks in the editor, you might want to take those into consideration when calculating the middle line. If the middle line falls within a folded code block, you may need to expand that code block to ensure that the cursor lands on the desired line.

Here's an updated version of your code that takes folded code blocks into account:

kotlin
Copy code
val editor: Editor = event.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
val foldingModel: FoldingModel = editor.foldingModel
val scrollingModel: ScrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel
val selectionModel: SelectionModel = editor.selectionModel
val document: Document = editor.document

// Get vertical scroll offset and line height of editor
val verticalScrollOffset = scrollingModel.verticalScrollOffset
val lineHeight = editor.lineHeight

// Calculate the first visible line
val firstVisibleLine = verticalScrollOffset / lineHeight

// Calculate the number of visible lines in the editor's visible area
val visibleAreaHeight = scrollingModel.visibleArea.height
val visibleLineCount = visibleAreaHeight / lineHeight

val lastVisibleLine = firstVisibleLine + visibleLineCount

// Calculate the middle visible line
val middleVisibleLine = (firstVisibleLine + lastVisibleLine) / 2

// Check if the middle line falls within a folded code block
if (foldingModel.isOffsetCollapsed(document.getLineStartOffset(middleVisibleLine))) {
    // Expand the folded code block
    foldingModel.runBatchFoldingOperation {
        foldingModel.expand(middleVisibleLine)
    }
}

// Move the cursor to the calculated middle line, considering to stay within document bounds
val middleLineOffset = document.getLineStartOffset(middleVisibleLine.coerceIn(0, document.lineCount - 1))
editor.caretModel.moveToOffset(middleLineOffset)

// Remove selection blocks before jumping
if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
    selectionModel.removeSelection(/* allCarets = */ true)
}
In this version, I've added logic to check if the middle line falls within a folded code block (foldingModel.isOffsetCollapsed). If it does, the code block is expanded (foldingModel.expand) before moving the cursor. This ensures that the cursor lands on the desired line even if it's within a folded code block.

Make sure to import the necessary classes (FoldingModel, Editor, ScrollingModel, SelectionModel, Document, etc.) if you haven't already done so.

I think there is not expand() method for foldingModel.
ChatGPT
You're correct. My apologies for the oversight. In the IntelliJ Platform SDK, there isn't a direct expand() method for the FoldingModel class. Instead, you can use the toggleCollapsedStatus() method to toggle the collapsed status of a specific folding region.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

kotlin
Copy code
val editor: Editor = event.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
val foldingModel: FoldingModel = editor.foldingModel
val scrollingModel: ScrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel
val selectionModel: SelectionModel = editor.selectionModel
val document: Document = editor.document

// Get vertical scroll offset and line height of editor
val verticalScrollOffset = scrollingModel.verticalScrollOffset
val lineHeight = editor.lineHeight

// Calculate the first visible line
val firstVisibleLine = verticalScrollOffset / lineHeight

// Calculate the number of visible lines in the editor's visible area
val visibleAreaHeight = scrollingModel.visibleArea.height
val visibleLineCount = visibleAreaHeight / lineHeight

val lastVisibleLine = firstVisibleLine + visibleLineCount

// Calculate the middle visible line
val middleVisibleLine = (firstVisibleLine + lastVisibleLine) / 2

// Check if the middle line falls within a folded code block
if (foldingModel.isOffsetCollapsed(document.getLineStartOffset(middleVisibleLine))) {
    // Expand the folded code block
    val foldingGroup = FoldingGroup.newGroup("myGroup")
    foldingModel.runBatchFoldingOperation {
        foldingModel.toggleCollapsedStatus(document.getLineStartOffset(middleVisibleLine))
    }
}

// Move the cursor to the calculated middle line, considering to stay within document bounds
val middleLineOffset = document.getLineStartOffset(middleVisibleLine.coerceIn(0, document.lineCount - 1))
editor.caretModel.moveToOffset(middleLineOffset)

// Remove selection blocks before jumping
if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
    selectionModel.removeSelection(/* allCarets = */ true)
}
In this code, toggleCollapsedStatus() is used to toggle the collapsed status of the folding region at the specified offset. This should expand the folded code block if it's collapsed.

foldingModel has these methods runBatchFoldingOperation, isOffsetCollapsed, addFoldRegion, allFoldRegion, removeFoldRegion, etc.
ChatGPT
Apologies for the confusion. It seems there isn't a direct method to expand a folded code block using the FoldingModel in the IntelliJ Platform SDK. Instead, you can try to simulate a mouse click on the folding region's gutter icon to expand it. Here's how you can do it:

kotlin
Copy code
val editor: Editor = event.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
val foldingModel: FoldingModel = editor.foldingModel
val scrollingModel: ScrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel
val selectionModel: SelectionModel = editor.selectionModel
val document: Document = editor.document

// Get vertical scroll offset and line height of editor
val verticalScrollOffset = scrollingModel.verticalScrollOffset
val lineHeight = editor.lineHeight

// Calculate the first visible line
val firstVisibleLine = verticalScrollOffset / lineHeight

// Calculate the number of visible lines in the editor's visible area
val visibleAreaHeight = scrollingModel.visibleArea.height
val visibleLineCount = visibleAreaHeight / lineHeight

val lastVisibleLine = firstVisibleLine + visibleLineCount

// Calculate the middle visible line
val middleVisibleLine = (firstVisibleLine + lastVisibleLine) / 2

// Check if the middle line falls within a folded code block
val middleLineStartOffset = document.getLineStartOffset(middleVisibleLine)
val foldRegions = foldingModel.allFoldRegions
for (region in foldRegions) {
    if (region.startOffset <= middleLineStartOffset && middleLineStartOffset < region.endOffset) {
        // Found a fold region that contains the middle line, simulate a mouse click on its gutter icon to expand it
        foldingModel.runBatchFoldingOperation {
            region.setExpanded(true)
        }
        break
    }
}

// Move the cursor to the calculated middle line, considering to stay within document bounds
val middleLineOffset = middleLineStartOffset.coerceIn(0, document.textLength - 1)
editor.caretModel.moveToOffset(middleLineOffset)

// Remove selection blocks before jumping
if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
    selectionModel.removeSelection(/* allCarets = */ true)
}
In this code, we first iterate through all fold regions (foldRegions) to find the one that contains the middle line. Once found, we use the setExpanded() method to expand it. Finally, we move the cursor to the calculated middle line and remove any selection blocks.

Can I skip the folded portion or consider or count fold as a single line for more convenience?
ChatGPT
Yes, you can skip the folded portion or consider a fold as a single line for convenience. You can achieve this by adjusting the logic to calculate the middle line based on the folded regions. Here's how you can do it:

kotlin
Copy code
val editor: Editor = event.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
val foldingModel: FoldingModel = editor.foldingModel
val scrollingModel: ScrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel
val selectionModel: SelectionModel = editor.selectionModel
val document: Document = editor.document

// Get vertical scroll offset and line height of editor
val verticalScrollOffset = scrollingModel.verticalScrollOffset
val lineHeight = editor.lineHeight

// Calculate the first visible line
val firstVisibleLine = verticalScrollOffset / lineHeight

// Calculate the number of visible lines in the editor's visible area
val visibleAreaHeight = scrollingModel.visibleArea.height
val visibleLineCount = visibleAreaHeight / lineHeight

val lastVisibleLine = firstVisibleLine + visibleLineCount

// Calculate the middle visible line while considering folded regions as single lines
val middleVisibleLine = (firstVisibleLine + lastVisibleLine) / 2

// Adjust the middle line to skip folded regions
var adjustedMiddleLine = middleVisibleLine
val foldRegions = foldingModel.allFoldRegions
for (region in foldRegions) {
    if (region.startLine < middleVisibleLine) {
        adjustedMiddleLine--
    }
}

// Move the cursor to the calculated middle line, considering to stay within document bounds
val middleLineOffset = document.getLineStartOffset(adjustedMiddleLine.coerceIn(0, document.lineCount - 1))
editor.caretModel.moveToOffset(middleLineOffset)

// Remove selection blocks before jumping
if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
    selectionModel.removeSelection(/* allCarets = */ true)
}
In this code, we iterate through the fold regions and adjust the middle line based on the folded regions encountered before it. This way, folded regions are considered as single lines when calculating the middle line. Adjusting the middle line in this way ensures that the cursor jumps to the correct position, skipping over folded portions.

Instead how can I consider blocked portion as a single line while calculating the middleVisibleLine?
ChatGPT
To consider blocked portions as a single line while calculating the middleVisibleLine, you can adjust the logic to treat folded regions as a single line. Here's how you can do it:

kotlin
Copy code
val editor: Editor = event.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
val foldingModel: FoldingModel = editor.foldingModel
val scrollingModel: ScrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel
val selectionModel: SelectionModel = editor.selectionModel
val document: Document = editor.document

// Get vertical scroll offset and line height of editor
val verticalScrollOffset = scrollingModel.verticalScrollOffset
val lineHeight = editor.lineHeight

// Calculate the first visible line
val firstVisibleLine = verticalScrollOffset / lineHeight

// Calculate the number of visible lines in the editor's visible area
val visibleAreaHeight = scrollingModel.visibleArea.height
val visibleLineCount = visibleAreaHeight / lineHeight

val lastVisibleLine = firstVisibleLine + visibleLineCount

// Calculate the middle visible line while considering folded regions as single lines
var totalLines = 0
for (line in firstVisibleLine until lastVisibleLine) {
    if (!foldingModel.isOffsetCollapsed(document.getLineStartOffset(line))) {
        totalLines++
    }
}

val middleVisibleLine = firstVisibleLine + (totalLines / 2)

// Move the cursor to the calculated middle line, considering to stay within document bounds
val middleLineOffset = document.getLineStartOffset(middleVisibleLine.coerceIn(0, document.lineCount - 1))
editor.caretModel.moveToOffset(middleLineOffset)

// Remove selection blocks before jumping
if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
    selectionModel.removeSelection(/* allCarets = */ true)
}
In this code, we iterate through the visible lines and check if each line is inside a folded region. If a line is not inside a folded region, we count it as one line. After counting the total number of visible lines (excluding folded regions), we calculate the middleVisibleLine based on the total count. This way, folded regions are considered as a single line when calculating the middle line. Adjusting the middle line in this way ensures that the cursor jumps to the correct position, skipping over folded portions.

It is not working somehow...

I apologize for the inconvenience. Let me provide you with an alternative approach to calculate the middleVisibleLine considering folded regions as a single line:

kotlin
Copy code
val editor: Editor = event.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
val foldingModel: FoldingModel = editor.foldingModel
val scrollingModel: ScrollingModel = editor.scrollingModel
val selectionModel: SelectionModel = editor.selectionModel
val document: Document = editor.document

// Get vertical scroll offset and line height of editor
val verticalScrollOffset = scrollingModel.verticalScrollOffset
val lineHeight = editor.lineHeight

// Calculate the first visible line
val firstVisibleLine = verticalScrollOffset / lineHeight

// Calculate the number of visible lines in the editor's visible area
val visibleAreaHeight = scrollingModel.visibleArea.height
val visibleLineCount = visibleAreaHeight / lineHeight

val lastVisibleLine = firstVisibleLine + visibleLineCount

// Calculate the middle visible line while considering folded regions as single lines
var visibleLines = mutableListOf<Int>()
for (line in firstVisibleLine until lastVisibleLine) {
    if (!foldingModel.isOffsetCollapsed(document.getLineStartOffset(line))) {
        visibleLines.add(line)
    }
}

val middleVisibleLine = if (visibleLines.isNotEmpty()) {
    val middleIndex = visibleLines.size / 2
    visibleLines[middleIndex]
} else {
    (firstVisibleLine + lastVisibleLine) / 2
}

// Move the cursor to the calculated middle line, considering to stay within document bounds
val middleLineOffset = document.getLineStartOffset(middleVisibleLine.coerceIn(0, document.lineCount - 1))
editor.caretModel.moveToOffset(middleLineOffset)

// Remove selection blocks before jumping
if (selectionModel.hasSelection()) {
    selectionModel.removeSelection(/* allCarets = */ true)
}
In this code, we collect the indices of visible lines that are not inside folded regions in a list visibleLines. Then, we calculate the middleVisibleLine based on the indices of visible lines collected. If the visibleLines list is empty, we fallback to the original calculation method. Adjusting the middleVisibleLine in this way should help in skipping folded portions and correctly positioning the cursor at the middle line.

All files have some common lines like: 			val editor: Editor = event.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
Can I reduce the duplicacy for all files?
ChatGPT
Yes, you can reduce the duplicacy of common lines in multiple files by creating a utility function or method to encapsulate the common functionality. Here's an example of how you can refactor your code to achieve this:

kotlin
Copy code
// Define a utility function to get the editor
fun getEditor(event: AnActionEvent): Editor {
    return event.getRequiredData(CommonDataKeys.EDITOR)
}

// Usage in your actionPerformed method
override fun actionPerformed(event: AnActionEvent) {
    val editor: Editor = getEditor(event)
    // Use 'editor' as needed
}
By extracting the common functionality into a separate utility function like getEditor, you can call this function from anywhere in your code where you need to access the editor. This helps in reducing duplicacy and makes your code more maintainable. Additionally, if you need to make changes to how you obtain the editor in the future, you only need to update the utility function in one place rather than in multiple places throughout your code.
